    <h1>Why I Built GUBER</h1>

    <div class="section">

        <p><em>The Imagination That Saved a Child.<br>
        The Grind That Built a Man.<br>
        The Vision That Created GUBER.</em></p>

        <p>Long before GUBER existed… long before the neon colors, the logo, or the mascot… there was a boy who survived the world using only one thing: <strong>his imagination.</strong></p>

        <p>Growing up, Mr. T didn’t have comfort, structure, or a soft place to fall. He didn’t have the resources, the support, or the guidance most kids rely on.</p>

        <p>But he had a mind that refused to shut down — a mind that created entire worlds when reality felt too heavy, a mind that could picture happiness when life gave him none.</p>

        <p>Imagination wasn’t childish. It was survival.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>2016 — The Grind Begins</h2>

        <p>As an adult, Mr. T built his first real business in 2016. No shortcuts. No handouts. Just hustle.</p>

        <p>Then life shifted. The woman he loved entered medical school, and he committed to supporting her — not with talk, but with action.</p>

        <p>He drove four hours back and forth between cities for over a year, sacrificing his time, money, business, and stability just to keep the relationship together.</p>

        <p>He sold off his tools and equipment, watching the business he'd built fade away piece by piece. But he kept going.</p>

        <p>Norfolk → Macon → Mobile… each move demanded a new sacrifice. Each one cost him more than the last.</p>

        <p>And eventually, the truth surfaced — the truth about loyalty, love, and everything he thought he was building.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>GUBER — Born From the Bottom</h2>

        <p>When everything collapsed — the business, the trust, the relationship — something awakened inside him.</p>

        <p>The child who survived using imagination grew into a man who refused to stay down.</p>

        <p>Out of heartbreak, loss, and frustration came a decision:</p>

        <p><strong>If the world wasn’t going to give him opportunity, he would build it.</strong></p>

        <p>Not just for himself — but for everyone who ever struggled like him.</p>

        <p>That decision became GUBER.</p>

        <p>GUBER wasn’t built from inspiration. It was built from survival. It became a platform for hustlers, helpers, workers, grinders — people who need opportunity now, not “someday.”</p>

        <h2>Gubee — The Imagination Reborn</h2>

        <!-- GUBEE IMAGE RIGHT ABOVE HIS SECTION -->
        <img src="Oggubee.webp" alt="Gubee Mascot" class="gubee">

        <p>Years later, the imagination that saved him as a child returned with a new purpose.</p>

        <p>A new character emerged — <strong>Gubee</strong> — glowing, friendly, futuristic. A mascot built to inspire the next generation.</p>

        <p>Adults will see GUBER as opportunity… but kids will grow up seeing GUBER as a world of heroes.</p>

        <p>Gubee represents:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>help</li>
            <li>hope</li>
            <li>hustle</li>
            <li>responsibility</li>
            <li>imagination</li>
            <li>a better future</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Gubee is the child Mr. T never got to raise — the symbol of what he wanted to give the world.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>This Is the True Origin of Mr. T</h2>

        <p>A man shaped by struggle.</p>
        <p>Driven by sacrifice.</p>
        <p>Fueled by imagination.</p>
        <p>Rebuilt by pain.</p>

        <p>GUBER and Gubee aren’t business ideas. They are the result of a lifetime of survival, learning, rebuilding, and vision.</p>

        <p>This is the story of how a child’s imagination built a platform that will change the world.</p>
