    <h1>The True Origin Story of GUBER & Gubee</h1>

    <div class="section-box">
        <p>
            GUBER didn’t come from a business plan or some tech meeting.  
            It came from my life — the real, messy parts that forced me to rebuild myself from the ground up.
        </p>

        <p>
            Back in <strong>2016</strong>, I built my business from nothing. Grinding. Hustling. 
            Creating a future with my own hands.  
            Then the woman I loved started medical school — and I did what I believed a supportive man should do.
        </p>

        <p>
            For over a year, I drove four hours back and forth between cities, trying to make money while still being present for her.  
            I fought to keep my business alive. I stretched myself thin.  
            Eventually the travel wore me down, and I started selling off the things I owned — just to survive and support her dreams.
        </p>

        <p>
            Years later, when her residency ended, it happened again — but worse.  
            She told me she was “back home with her mom,” waiting on military orders… crying, sounding defeated.  
            But the truth was different.
        </p>

        <p>
            She had already started a new career <strong>five states away</strong>.  
            She had already made friends. Already built a new life.  
            And she kept me believing for <strong>three months</strong> — calling, pretending, letting me wait.
        </p>

        <p>
            While I waited for her, I was 14 hours away — living in a city I never would’ve been in if I wasn’t supporting her journey.  
            And that distance stole something from me I can never get back:
            <strong>time with my mother before she passed.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            When my mom died, the woman I loved didn’t show up.  
            Didn’t help. Didn’t watch the dogs.  
            Didn’t stand beside me through the worst moment of my life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually grief and pressure broke me down so much that I had to give up the dogs — the last pieces of the life I thought I was building.
        </p>

        <p>
            And after everything…  
            When I finally uncovered the truth and confronted her —  
            <strong>she vanished.</strong>  
            No apology.  
            No explanation.  
            It was like I never existed.
        </p>

    <h2>The Birth of GUBER</h2>

    <div class="section-box">
        <p>
            But this isn’t a story about loss — it’s a story about what loss created.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because even at rock bottom, I’ve always known how to rebuild.  
            And while climbing up from nothing again, I realized something:
        </p>

        <p><strong>
            Most people fall behind because help takes too long.
            Most people lose everything because work takes too long.
            Most people need opportunity right now — not next week.
        </strong></p>

        <p>
            GUBER was born from that truth.  
            From survival.  
            From the understanding that people deserve a way to make money today, get help today, and rebuild without waiting on anyone.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h2>Gubee — The Child Who Survived</h2>

    <div class="section-box">
        <p>
            Gubee wasn’t just a mascot idea — he was the imagination I grew up with returning to save me again.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a kid, imagination was the only thing that kept me alive.  
            As an adult, it became the fuel to build a future no one could take from me.
        </p>

        <p>
            Gubee represents:
            help, hope, hustle, responsibility, and a better future.
        </p>

        <p>
            He is the child I never got to raise.  
            The one whose mother walked away before he was ever born.  
            So I raised him myself — through creativity, vision, and purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
            And now he will raise a new generation —  
            teaching them confidence, ambition, work ethic, and belief in themselves.
